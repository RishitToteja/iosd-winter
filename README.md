# CURE (Your one stop solution for all medical problems!)

# INTRODUCTION

Our Project mainly focuses on solving 3 major problems faced in the healthcare industry.

1) The first problem arises due to the fact that there is a shortage of Doctors, particularly in India. Specifically in Rural areas, people don't have access to good doctors and thus, if people want to consult a doctor, either it's very expensive or they don't get proper consultation. With our project, we try to solve this problem by making Artificial Intelligence powered Chatbot.

2) The second primary problem we try to solve is maintaining the privacy of user’s medical records.In February 2015 an NPR report claimed that organized crime networks had ways of selling health data in the black market. In 2015 a Beazley Group employee estimated that medical records could sell on the black market for US$40-50.Sensitive data are collected by healthcare organizations from their customers and stored on network servers to make them accessible all the time, and to facilitate patient care, but unfortunately, every blessing has a curse, which also applies here. This leads to the exposure of sensitive data in the form of data breaches. Sometimes, insider attackers cause damage to protected health information, which results in the loss, theft, or disclosure of sensitive healthcare data. We try to solve this problem by introducing a blockchain based file storage system which helps in securing all of the user’s data.

3) 3rd problem we tried to solve was to ensure authenticity of receipts and prescriptions. This would allow us to prevent people from buying prescription medicines without prescriptions. The insurance companies would be able to verify the receipts and check for fraud without sacrificing the privacy of the users.

# SOLUTION 

1) AI MEDICAL CHATBOT: 

Chatbots are interactive applications that are designed to simulate human conversations. The main purpose is to provide a convenient way for individuals to reach out to a company and get help.Chatbots use a combination of artificial intelligence and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to process inputs and compose replies. The backend of the chatbot with the help of PyTorch framework using a combination of Neural Hidden layers, Activation layers and finally an output layer. To train the model, we scraped the internet to build a dataset which consisted of lots of medical queries and their answers.

Advantages of chatbots in the healthcare industry:

a) Reduced Waiting Times

b) Scalable Customer Service

c) Timely Medical Advice

d) Appointment Scheduling

e) Massive Cost Savings

2) BLOCKCHAIN BASED DATA STORAGE SYSTEM: 

We have built a blockchain based healthcare data record system which allows us to store the data of patients on a blockchain using ethereum. It gives patient data to only assigned doctors ensuring data privacy and security.

3) BLOCKCHAIN BASED CHEMIST SHOP 

Blockchain based chemist shop for ensuring data privacy and to ensure that only patients with real prescriptions can take medicines which require a prescription. Also this would allow insurance companies to have an authentic record without sacrificing the privacy of the patients.

Advantages of Blockchain in Healthcare Industry: 

a) Healthcare industry, helping protect patient health data when transporting it.

b) The system does not store data of any kind, thus not prone to data leak.

c) It operates as both a network and a protocol to set policies and configure data layers while verifying the sources and destinations of data in real time.
